# CopiableLabelSubclass
A subclass of UILabel that allows the label's text to be copied when the user initiates a long press

To implement, create a new UILabel in storyboard, and set its class to this UICopiableLabel subclass.

Credit to https://github.com/markiv/PPCopiableLabel for the abilty to ignore a continuous long press gesture.
